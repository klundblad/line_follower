# line_follower 
A few other undergrads and I are designing an Introduction to Electrical Engineering class,
and these are some designs to minimize the size of the electronics on board of our line following robot.

PCB's for EE 299 Robot (Photo resistors and PID control):
This circuit utilizes basic, passive components to sense between light colors and dark colors in order
to follow a path marked by dark lines. Motors on the robot are tuned via PID control from four passive 
potentiometers

# V1
Very sad day when I didn't route power to any of the components on the board :(
